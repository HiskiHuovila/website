Thesis Origins
</title><description><![CDATA[

<p>Welcome to my journey to write my Master's thesis on tabletop roleplaying games. There isn't much to say at this time but I am required to start with a short summary of my intial topic, so here goes:
Enemy Balance in B/X-Derivative OSR Tabletop Roleplaying Games</p>

<p>OSR (old-school revival, renaissance or revolution) is a philosophical movement focused on playing and creating tabletop roleplaying games that recreate the gameplay experience of early editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. A core tenet of this movement is disregard for mathematical balance in enemy design which makes it difficult for new designers to create games and content for this audience. As these games are highly derivative of the original versions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons this thesis studies the similarities and differences in enemy design between these games and their original inspirations.</p>

<p>Let's see how this goes</p>
